        The WinPoker app calculates the chance to win Texas Hold\'em. You only need to enter YOUR two
        private cards, not those of your opponents that you usually do not know. Then you enter
        incrementally the 3 + 1 +1, that is, 5 public face-up cards. The app internally plays
        hundreds of games every time more information is available (first your two private cards,
        then the public cards which we call Talon: 3 cards, then one card, the so-called \'turn\',
        and finally a last one, the so-called \'river\'), by randomly drawing cards also for your
        fictive opponents and counting the games in which you would have won. This approximates
        extremely well the actual chance you have to win.
        \n\n
        Using the WinPoker app is as simple as dealing cards:
        \n\n
        1. Select your number of opponents by pressing the number in the top right corner. You can
        change the number of opponents at any time.
        \n\n
        2. Enter YOUR two private cards in the section Player Pocket. Just take a picture of the two
        cards by clicking on the camera symbol right to the text Pocket Cards. It does not matter
        whether you take pictures in landscape or portrait orientation. Just make sure that the
        cards are in the picture. The WinPoker app\'s image recognition usually reads your cards
        correctly. If not, you can correct each card by clicking on its rank or suit. A pop-up menu
        allows you to modify rank and suit. As an alternative to taking a picture, you could also
        enter the suit and rank of each card manually by clicking on the particular hyphen \'â€“\'
        \n\n
        3. Enter the three face-up cards that are visible to everyone (the \'flop\') in the section
        Talon Cards, again either by taking a picture (by clicking on the camera symbol right to the
        text Talon Cards) or entering them manually. Note that you can hide your private cards
        (Pocket Cards) as well as your chance of winning and best hand by pressing the HIDE ALL
        ABOVE button. This is important if you take a picture, because your opponents might see your
        private information then. When only you view the display, the SHOW ALL ABOVE button shows
        your private information again. Note that the \'Best hand\' is only shown after you entered
        your pocket cards and the first 3 talon cards, because only then a hand consisting of 5
        cards can be formed.
        \n\n
        4. Enter the next face-up card (the \'turn\', the fourth card in the Talon Pocket), again
        either by taking another picture (typically only of this one card) or entering the card
        manually.
        \n\n
        5. Enter the final face-up card (the \'river\', the fifth card in the Talon Pocket), again
        either by taking another picture (typically only of this one card) or entering the card
        manually.
        \n\n
        6. By pressing START FROM SCRATCH you play another round (point 2 above).

        Usage:\n\n
        1. Select your number of opponents by pressing the number in the top right corner\n\n
        2. Take a picture of your hand by pressing the camera symbol next to \"Pocket Cards\" and tapping on the screen when both cards are in focus.\n\n
        3. Take a picture of the first three cards on the table using the camera symbol next to \"Talon Cards\".\n\n
        4. Do the same with the 4th and the 5th card.\n\n\n
        Pro Tips:\n\n
        - If a card isn\'t recognized correctly, you can tap on the rank or the suit of the card to change it.\n\n
        - By pressing \"Hide all above\" you hide your chance of winning and the cards in your hand.\n\n
        - After a game ends, you can press \"Start from scratch\" to start a new game.\n\n
        - The best hand only gets calculated after you entered your pocket cards and the first 3 talon cards
